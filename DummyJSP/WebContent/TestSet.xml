			<Q>
				In a cricket match, the ‘man of the match’ award is given to the
				player scoring the highest number of runs. In case of a tie, the
				player (out of those locked in the tie) who has taken the higher
				number of catches is chosen. Even thereafter if there is a tie, the
				player (out of those locked in the tie) who has dropped fewer
				catches is selected. Aakash, Biplab and Chirag who were contenders
				for the award dropped at least one catch each. Biplab dropped 2
				catches more than Aakash did, scored 50, and took 2 catches. Chirag
				got two chances to catch and dropped both.
				Who was the ‘man of the
				match’?
				A. Chirag made 15 runs less than both Aakash and Biplab.
